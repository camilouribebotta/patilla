## Watermelon, what the angels eat. 

Mark Twain once said that watermelon “it is the chief of this world's luxuries, king by the grace of God over all the fruits of the earth. When one has tasted it, he knows what the angels eat. It was not a Southern watermelon that Eve took; we know it because she repented.”  Though today “watermelon” calls to mind a sturdy melon with deliciously refreshing, sweet, red flesh, for most of its several millennia history as a cultivated crop, it was known as a pale, hard, sometimes bitter fruit with relatively tender rind, more akin in look and taste to a modern cucumber. More than three thousand years after watermelon-like fruit first appeared in Egyptian iconography, in the fifth century CE, watermelons were still described by Greek and Latin authors merely as “large, round, moist, and easy to digest,” of which “best ones are sweet,” though their use of “sweet” probably just meant a not savory or bitter taste.  Not until the sixth century CE do watermelons appear to be associated with sweet fruits like figs, grapes, and pomegranates, and only well into 1400s do the uniformly red, thick-rounded watermelons that we recognize today begin to appear

### Whose vine is it anyway?
Ironically, the origins and history of the watermelon are obscured by its commonness, diversity, and its most iconic component — the tender, watery flesh, which does not survive well in the archaeological record. “Watermelon” today often refers specifically to the “sweet dessert” cultivars of the _Citrullus lanatus_ species, but the _Citrullus_ genus includes at least six other species of watermelons, including the citron _(C. caffer)_ , egusi _(C. mucosospermus)_ and colocynth _(C. colocynthis)_, which at one time either were called or were classified as subspecies of _C. lanatus._ Thus the taxonomy of the sweet dessert watermelon is of minimal use for tracing its origins until further genetic analysis is confirmed; instead, literary references and depictions of watermelons stretching back millennia have been used to identify and trace the evolving phenotypes of the modern watermelon.

The species in the genus _Citrullus_ characteristically grow on vines with pinnatifid (feather-like) leaves with only a few pale-yellow flowers. The glossy, outermost rind is often distinctly patterned with jagged stripes of two shades of green, covering a thicker, white inner rind that encases the softer flesh that, when ripe, ranges from red to yellow to green and white.  Though its origin is still in contention and has been located throughout the African continent, current hypotheses point to its origin and first domestication in northeastern Africa around 6000 years ago. Wild dessert watermelons have been found throughout Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Kenya,  and some of the earliest iconography of oblong — an indication of domestication — melons can be found in Egyptian tombs, including the famous King Tutankhamen

Early on, watermelons were welcomed in the arid savanna regions especially as sources of water, where the flesh was generally cooked or beaten to a pulp to extract the water. In the societies of Kalahari Desert in southern Africa, for example, the multiple uses of the flesh, rind, and seeds in their fresh, cooked, and dried forms enable groups to remain sedentary and hydrated throughout the wet and dry seasons.  As they continued to be cultivated, watermelons were likely bred to yield softer and sweeter flesh, excluding traits like the mucilaginous seeds of the egusi or the hard, bitter flesh of the citron melon, though western and southern African cuisines, respectively, still make use of these features today.

### Seing Red... Eventually

Since the taxonomical and genetic records remain tangled until further study, the literary, visual, and cultural references to the watermelon actually reveal a great deal about the watermelon’s history and development. The variety of terms in ancient texts — pepon, melopepon, kolokynte — and the tangled taxonomy of watermelon varieties makes it uncertain whether they refer specifically to Citrullus lanatus, but this in fact gives a vivid portrait of some of the modern watermelon’s predecessors and competitors. Around 77 CE, Pliny writes, in various sections of his Natural History dedicated to “cucumbers” of all sorts, of a pepones as a “refrigerant maxime,” whose seeds, rinds, roots, and leaves are useful for alleviating pain or inducing vomiting; the “watermelon” was not quite refreshing in the way that we enjoy it now.

Later in the millennium, watermelons arrived in India by the ninth century CE and China by the twelfth century via trade routes.  The watermelon and its sinewy vines soon became an icon seeming to express vitality, playfulness, and decoration that still persists today, appearing in Iranian encyclopedic manuscripts from the fifteenth century and as an offer to the goods in Japanese buddhist representations of arhats, the one who reaches the nirvana in Buddhist tradition), where the watermelon is seen in spiritual terms as a religious offer. It also appears alongside butterflies, insects, and even mice in Korean paintings from the early Joseon Dynasty. Shin Saimdang (1504–1551), the best-known female artist in the 16th century Joseon Dynasty, for example depicts the watermelon in symbolic interactions with nearby flowers, butterflies, and mice.  The arching vines of the watermelon plant and seeds exposed by the mice symbolize wishes for healthy and abundant children, reinforced by the nearby dianthus flower symbolizing a wish for “no white hairs,” or lasting youth. Another one of Shin’s depictions of watermelons appears on the 5000 won banknote today, as a reminder of Shin’s dedication to art, family, civic virtue, and gender equality.

Moorish conquerors left agricultural evidence — seeds, mostly — of the watermelon in the tenth century CE in Spain, and illuminated manuscripts shed light on the varieties of watermelons in southern Italy, though still considered among cucumbers. Just as the watermelons of early modern Korean art appeared appealing to a host of animals and insects, the watermelon in Europe as it appears in manuscripts seemed to more palatable than Pliny’s pepones: early health treatises (Tacuinum Sanitatis) commissioned by Italian nobility in the 14th century, where it was labeled as Anguria, show that they may have been so delectable that harvesters could taste test them in the fields. Curiously, the melones dulces (sweet melon) appears to be regarded with a bit more reserve, suggesting that the 'sweet' designation perhaps did not indicate the sweetness we expect today. Indeed, writing in the 16th century, John Gerard, in his Herball or Generall Historie of Plants describes the flesh as “spungie and of a flimsie substance,” which can be “eaten rawe, but more commonly boiled” and is still more notable for its alleviating effects: ¡it ingendereth a waterish bloud, mitigateth the extremitie of heat of the inner parts, and tempereth the sharpness and fervent heat of choler.'

By the eighteenth century, watermelons were commonly cultivated practically the world over: European colonists introduced the crop to indigenous populations in Canada, the American South, and Hawaii, and African slaves brought the fruit to eastern North America, the Caribbean, South America and Brazil.  The visual references to the fruit reflect its proliferation, surfacing as a common motif famously in European and American still lifes, which also reflect the ongoing variety, confusion, and exchange of watermelons. Albert Eckhout’s 17th century still life of “Brazilian fruits” depicts a watermelon with whorls of the familiar red flesh amongst the white rind, attesting to a less uniformly dessert-like watermelon. The still lifes also depict the multitude of cultural valences associated with the fruit: whereas American still lifes of the fruit, like those of the prolific Peale family in the early 19th century, place the melon amidst almost nauseating abundance and plenty — as in the vivid homogeneity of the red flesh — European artists would often cut through that fantasy (literally) with the abrupt imposition of a knife, a harsh reminder of the fleeting richness of life. Sometimes the witness to the competing cultural and botanical influences, as in an album of Asian fruits from the start of the 19th century held by Dumbarton Oaks : likely executed by a Chinese artist working in Malaysia or Sumatra, with perhaps Arabic labels, the watermelon sits in isolation like a European botanical specimen.

## As a racist trope

In nineteenth and twentieth century America, the watermelon became a racist trope associated with African Americans. After emancipation in 1863 the watermelon briefly became a tool of black citizenship; the ease with which watermelons could be grown and sold meant that they could became a source of income for freed slaves, the fruit already having a longer tradition of cultivation in slave gardens.  Although initially holding a certain amount of emancipatory potential for African Americans both through their sale enabling the escape of the plantation economy, and through the eating of watermelons as a public and communal activity, enacting newfound freedoms, the watermelon soon became perceived as a threat by white southerners who proceeded to transform the fruit into a symbol of black people’s unfitness for freedom and citizenship.

Certain characteristics of the watermelon made it conducive to racializing: its messiness when eating connoting uncleanliness, its easiness to grow implying laziness, its sweetness and colour connoting childishness. These aspects of the fruit were bound up with representations of African Americans whose taste for the melon were exaggerated to the point of naturalisation: “The negro’s fondness for the watermelon is nothing short of a racial weakness. They seem to be born with a hunger or a thirst for the fruit.” Not only did the consumption of watermelons become a racially charged trope in popular representation, but countless stories of stolen watermelons contributed to the establishment of black criminality following the 13th Amendment. The irresistible lure of the watermelon suggested that it did “more to tempt the colored race to steal than all other fruit combined”.  The narrative of watermelon-stealing by African Americans was so entrenched that in Tennessee, the state bill criminalizing trespass in 1870 was commonly known as the ‘watermelon bill’, serving to disenfranchise convicted trespassers. The popularity of such cultural tropes became important tools in exclusionary racial politics well into the twentieth century, and are still pervasive today.

### Watermelons and Cholera

The racist belief in the unhealthy habits of African Americans was also a feature in nineteenth century associations between watermelons and diseases such as cholera. The common belief that eating too much watermelon, especially when overripe, could lead to cholera led some cities to ban the fruit’s sale during cholera epidemics.  “Eating melons” was noted down as the cause of illness in several “colored people” in newspaper reports in 1832, and watermelons were referred to as “cholera bombshells”, “the watermelons and the undertaker [going] hand in hand” until the late nineteenth century.  Whilst it is unclear whether such direct and often exaggerated lines of causality between watermelons and cholera were accurate, contemporary evidence has shown that raw fruits and vegetables can be a frequent source of cholera infection, especially if fields are fertilized with uncomposted manure, or irrigated with contaminated water. The significance of watermelons specifically, rather than other types of fruit, in terms of cholera infections was almost certainly exaggerated to serve popular narratives in America at the time, but the association was also present in other areas of the world.

Poem: 
'Who started the cholera? 
I, said the Melon, 
I am the felon, 
From warmth of a torrider 
Country than Florida, 
I carried the cholera. 
We sailed to Marseilles 
With favoring gales, 
And from there we went on 
To visit Toulon. 
Where next do we do? 
Just wait; time will show. 
But it will not be long Y Ere the Germans will find, 
That cholera loves
A trip on the rind.'

### In contemporary life. 
Though a variety of watermelons appear throughout world cuisines, Citrullus lanatus alone enjoys no shortage of uses, especially resurging as healthy alternatives and attesting to the ongoing ubiquity of varieties and names. Seeds are roasted with a variety of oils and enjoyed as a snack in North African, Middle Eastern, and Chinese cuisines, and are entering the American healthy food scene.  “Watermelon steaks” have also become popular as substitutes for meat,  accomplished by grilling the flesh until the water evaporates, creating a fillet-like consistency. Commonly in West Africa, seeds are dried and pressed into ootanga or Kalahari oil, which has also increasingly been promoted as a natural skincare product.  The rind has traditionally been boiled and preserved in the American South, and the flesh is blended and cooked to create the traditional Sicilian dessert gelo d’anguria,  referencing an early modern name for today’s watermelon.

Since the twentieth century, the intensified commodification of the watermelon has resulted in multiple transformations in the fruit’s form. In many countries around the world (but not all), since the 2000s, watermelons have grown smaller, rounder, and more uniform in size in order to stack better for transit and sale. These so-called “personal melons” are more practical for transporting and storing in fridges, and importantly bring farmers bigger profits per acre.  The personal melon becomes a far cry from the fruit sharing as an act of community in the nineteenth-century American south. The other major transformation in watermelons has been the success of the seedless melon. The commercial production of seedless watermelons began in the 1990s, using colchicine – a chemical derived from crocuses – to double the number of chromosomes in a plant. The resulting tetraploid watermelon which has four sets of chromosomes is then back-crossed with a normal diploid watermelon with two sets of chromosomes to produce a sterile seedless triploid hybrid, with three sets of chromosomes.

Whilst the seedless watermelon now dominates the market, it’s hybridised sterility presents new challenges for farmers. Watermelon plants are bee-pollinated and since bees foraging in seedless watermelon plantings carry a mixture of viable and non-viable pollen, more bees are required for effective pollination. Without sufficient pollination, watermelons may grow with a “hollow heart” and cannot be sold. The number of bee hives required therefore rises to one or even two per acre.  Watermelon farmers in the US have turned to renting bees to meet their pollination needs, especially since the decline of the wild bee population from mass colony collapse disorder since 2006. There is increasing evidence that the transportation of bees for such purposes causes significant stress on the colonies due to, for example, changes in temperature, humidity, and vibration.  The market demand for convenience in the shape of seedless watermelons may thus come at a considerable ecological cost.

The shape of watermelons has also become a novelty in Asian markets, with square watermelons grown in moulds being developed in Japan in the 1980s. Originally the design was practical, intended to allow for more efficient stacking and fridge storage, but the high prices as a result of the increased labour required in cultivation became prohibitive, and today square and heart-shaped watermelons are sold as an expensive novelty for decorative purposes.
