## Watermelon, the food of angels

Mark Twain once said that watermelon “is the chief of this world's luxuries, king by the grace of God over all the fruits of the earth. When one has tasted it, he knows what the angels eat.” [1] Though today “watermelon” calls to mind a sturdy melon with refreshing, sweet, red flesh, for most of its millennia long history as a cultivated crop it was known as a pale, hard, sometimes bitter fruit with relatively tender rind. Not until the sixth century CE were watermelons associated with sweet fruits like figs and grapes, and it was not until well into the 1400s that the uniformly red, thick-rinded watermelons that we recognize today began to appear. Throughout its history, the watermelon has been associated with medicine, vitality, racism, and disease, revealing a darker side to the sweet summer fruit we know and love.

### Whose Vine Is It Anyway?
Ironically, the origins and history of the watermelon are obscured by its commonness, diversity, and its most iconic component — the tender, watery flesh, which does not survive well in the archaeological record. “Watermelon” today often refers specifically to the “sweet dessert” cultivars of the _Citrullus lanatus_ species, but the _Citrullus_ genus includes at least six other species of watermelons, including the citron _(C. amarus)_, egusi _(C. mucosospermus)_ and colocynth _(C. colocynthis)_ watermelons, which at one time were variously called or classified as subspecies of C. lanatus.[3] Past taxonomies of the sweet dessert watermelon are therefore of minimal use for tracing its origins until further genetic analysis is undertaken; instead, literary references and visual depictions of watermelons stretching back millennia have been used to identify and trace the evolving phenotypes of the modern watermelon.

Species in the genus _Citrullus_ characteristically grow on vines with pinnatifid (feather-like) leaves and only a few pale-yellow flowers. The glossy, outermost rind is often distinctly patterned with jagged stripes of two shades of green, covering a thicker, white inner rind that encases the softer flesh that, when ripe, ranges from red to yellow to green and white. Though its origin is still in contention and has been located throughout the African continent, current hypotheses point to its origin and first domestication in north-eastern Africa around six thousand years ago. Wild desert watermelons have been found throughout Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Kenya,[5] and some of the earliest iconography of oblong melons — an indication of domestication — can be found in Egyptian tombs, including that of King Tutankhamen [6] and Mediterranean and Byzantine mosaics.

In the arid savanna regions of Africa, watermelons were welcomed as sources of water, the flesh generally being cooked or beaten to a pulp to extract the water. In southern Africa’s Kalahari Desert, for example, the multiple uses of the flesh, rind, and seeds in their fresh, cooked, and dried forms helped some groups to remain sedentary and hydrated throughout the wet and dry seasons.[7] As they became domesticated, watermelons were bred to yield softer and sweeter flesh, excluding traits like the mucilaginous egusi seeds or the hard, bitter flesh of the citron melon, although western and southern African cuisines still make use of these elements today.[8]

### Seing Red... Eventually

Watermelons in ancient texts were written using a variety of terms including pepon, melopepon and kolokynte. Around 77 CE, Pliny dedicated a section of his Natural History to pepones, which, he wrote, made a very refreshing food, but also had a laxative effect. Various parts of the fruit were used to alleviate pain, to induce vomiting, and even to cleanse the skin and clear spots.[9] Fast-forward two thousand years to the year 1888, and US newspapers carried reports of a Miss Carrie Townsend from St. Louis who promoted the watermelon as face cleanser. Townsend, who felt sorry for girls with freckles who looked “as if they had been about when a bran bin had exploded”, claimed that no matter what was wrong with the face, the juice of the watermelon would rectify it.  Although perhaps not quite as powerful as Townsend suggests, watermelon is still considered by some to be an effective skin cleanser today.

By the ninth and twelfth centuries CE respectively, watermelons had arrived in India and China via regional routes.[10] The watermelon and its sinewy vines soon became a decorative icon, its associations with vitality and playfulness persisting today. In fourteenth-century Japanese Buddhist representations of arhats (those reaching nirvana in Buddhist tradition), watermelons appear in spiritual terms as a religious offering. Early Korean paintings from the Joseon Dynasty by the female artist Shin Saimdang (1504-1551) also depicted watermelons, symbolically alongside flowers, butterflies and mice. [11] The arching vines of the watermelon plant and seeds exposed by the mice symbolized wishes for healthy and abundant children, echoed in the nearby dianthus flower which represented a wish for “no white hairs,” or lasting youth. Another one of Shin’s depictions of watermelons appears on the 5000 won banknote today, as a reminder of Shin’s dedication to art, family, civic virtue and gender equality.[12]

Moorish conquerors of Spain left agricultural evidence of the watermelon, mostly in the shape of seeds, in the tenth century CE, and illuminated manuscripts shed light on the varieties of watermelons grown in southern Italy. The watermelon appearing in subsequent European manuscripts seemed to be more palatable than Pliny’s pepones: early health treatises (Tacuinum Sanitatis) commissioned by Italian nobility in the 14th century show that they may have been so delectable that harvesters would taste test them in the fields. However, the sweetness the melons does not appear to be consistent. Writing in the 16th century, John Gerard, in his Herball, described the flesh as “spungie and of a flimsie substance” which can be “eaten rawe, but more commonly boiled” and was still more notable for its healthful properties: “it ingendereth a waterish bloud, mitigateth the extremitie of heat of the inner parts, and tempereth the sharpness and fervent heat of choler.”[13]

In the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, the watermelon was commonly represented in European and American still lifes, providing a diverse visual archive of watermelon varieties. The seventeenth century watermelons of Eckhout and Stanchi, for example, exhibit whorls of red flesh amongst white rind and give us a sense of how much the watermelon has changed in the last few hundred years. The inclusion of watermelons in still lifes also provides an insight into the multitude of cultural values associated with the fruit at the time. Whilst American still lifes, such as those of the prolific Peale family in the early nineteenth century, placed the melon amidst almost nauseating abundance and plenty, European artists would often cut through that fantasy quite literally with the abrupt imposition of a knife as a harsh reminder of the fleeting nature of life.

Diverse types of watermelon are also represented in styles commonly associated with European botanical specimens with the fruits sitting in isolation, such as Maria Sybilla Merian’s work and the nineteenth century illustration shown here. This latter painting is taken from an album of Asian fruits held by Dumbarton Oaks, likely executed by a Chinese artist working in Malaysia or Sumatra. In it, different stages in the growth of the flower and the fruit are shown alongside the seeds and a vivid cross-section, again echoing the whorls of earlier depictions. This bright and appealingly visual nature of the modern watermelon left it uniquely open to enrolment into the racist visual tropes of nineteenth century America.

### Watermelons, Race, and the American South 

Watermelons had been grown in the Americas since the sixteenth century, introduced by colonists and African slaves and cultivated widely by indigenous populations and in slave gardens. After the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, the watermelon briefly became a tool of black citizenship; the ease with which watermelons could be grown and sold meant that they could became a source of income for freed slaves.16] Although initially holding a certain amount of emancipatory potential for African Americans both through their sale enabling the escape of the plantation economy, and through the eating of watermelons as a public and communal activity enacting newfound freedoms, the watermelon soon became perceived as a threat by white southerners who proceeded to transform the fruit into a symbol of black people’s unfitness for freedom and citizenship.

Certain characteristics of the watermelon made it conducive to racializing: its messiness when eating connoting uncleanliness, its easiness to grow implying laziness, its sweetness and colour connoting childishness. These aspects of the fruit were bound up with representations of African Americans whose taste for the melon were exaggerated to the point of naturalisation, the watermelon’s African origins cited as an explanation for black Americans’ apparently insatiable appetite for the fruit. Nineteenth-century newspapers were filled with anecdotes and reports which repeated these racial tropes until they masqueraded as truth.

Stories of stolen watermelons similarly contributed to the establishment of black criminality following the 13th Amendment. The irresistible lure of the watermelon suggested that it did “more to tempt the colored race to steal than all other fruit combined”, with countless anecdotes supposedly citing the words of African Americans claiming that stolen watermelons tasted better than bought.[18] The narrative of watermelon-stealing by African Americans was so entrenched that in Tennessee, the state bill criminalizing trespass in 1870 was commonly known as the ‘watermelon bill’, serving to disenfranchise convicted trespassers. The popularity of such cultural tropes became important tools in exclusionary racial politics well into the twentieth century, and are still pervasive today.[19]

### “Cholera Bombshells”

The racist belief in the unhealthy habits of African Americans also featured in nineteenth century associations between watermelons and disease. The common belief that eating too much watermelon, especially when overripe, could lead to cholera led some cities to ban the fruit’s sale during epidemics, watermelons referred to as “cholera bombshells”.[20] Whilst it is unclear whether such direct lines of causality between watermelons and cholera were accurate, contemporary evidence has shown that raw fruits and vegetables can be a frequent source of cholera infection, especially if fields are fertilized with uncomposted manure, or irrigated with contaminated water. The significance of watermelons specifically, rather than other types of fruit, in terms of cholera infections was almost certainly exaggerated to serve popular narratives in America at the time, but the association was also present in other parts of the world.

In Korea at the turn of the twentieth century, for instance, British mine-owners turned to banning watermelons from the camps of their workers in order to prevent outbreaks of cholera. The logic behind this seemed to lay in the “immense quantities” of watermelons consumed by Korean workers, including the “rind” (probably the white pith, thought good for indigestion), again suggesting a continuity between a racialized critique of excess indulgence and the moralizing of disease. The campaign turned out to be successful, although whether or not that was down to the lack of watermelons is unclear.[22] Similarly, posters such as that shown here from the USSR in 1921 used watermelons to illustrate how various acts of poor hygiene could lead to cholera, from drinking unboiled water to eating unwashed fruit.

Poem: 
'Who started the cholera? 
I, said the Melon, 
I am the felon, 
From warmth of a torrider 
Country than Florida, 
I carried the cholera. 
We sailed to Marseilles 
With favoring gales, 
And from there we went on 
To visit Toulon. 
Where next do we do? 
Just wait; time will show. 
But it will not be long Y Ere the Germans will find, 
That cholera loves
A trip on the rind.'

### Capitalism and the commodification of fruit 
Since the twentieth century, the intensified commodification of the watermelon has transformed the fruit’s form. In many countries around the world (but not all), since the 2000s, watermelons have grown smaller, rounder, and more uniform in size in order to stack better for transit and sale. These so-called “personal melons” are more practical for transporting and storing in fridges, and importantly bring farmers bigger profits per acre, heralding a shift away from the watermelon as a communally consumed fruit.[26] The other major transformation in watermelons has been the success of the seedless melon. The commercial production of seedless watermelons began in the 1990s, using colchicine – a chemical derived from crocuses – to produce a sterile seedless hybrid, crossbred to have three sets of chromosomes instead of two.[27]

<param ve-plant-specimen eid="Q17507129" max="2">

Whilst the seedless watermelon now dominates the market, it’s hybridized sterility presents new challenges for farmers. Watermelon plants are bee-pollinated, and since bees foraging in seedless watermelon plantings carry a mixture of viable and non-viable pollen, more bees are required for effective pollination. Without sufficient pollination, watermelons may grow with a “hollow heart” and cannot be sold. Watermelon farmers in the US have turned to renting bees to meet their pollination needs, especially since the decline of the wild bee population from mass colony collapse disorder in recent years. There is increasing evidence that the transportation of bees for such purposes causes significant stress on the colonies due to, for example, changes in temperature, humidity, and vibration.[29] The market demand for convenience in the shape of seedless watermelons may therefore come at a considerable ecological cost.

### Conclusion

As we have seen throughout this essay, the watermelon has undergone significant transformation since it was first cultivated in northern Africa six thousand years ago. Throughout its history, the watermelon was valued variously for its size, its sweetness, its health-giving properties, its appearance. Watermelons today vary significantly around the world in shape and size. Novelty square and heart-shaped watermelons developed in 1980s Japan for easy fridge storage are sold today at high prices almost exclusively for decorative purposes, as they are necessarily underripe due to the constrictive molds in which they are grown.[30] With consumer taste and market value governing the taste and form of watermelons grown, who knows what the future might hold…
