## Watermelon, what the angels eat. 

Mark Twain once said that watermelon “it is the chief of this world's luxuries, king by the grace of God over all the fruits of the earth. When one has tasted it, he knows what the angels eat. It was not a Southern watermelon that Eve took; we know it because she repented.”  Though today “watermelon” calls to mind a sturdy melon with deliciously refreshing, sweet, red flesh, for most of its several millennia history as a cultivated crop, it was known as a pale, hard, sometimes bitter fruit with relatively tender rind, more akin in look and taste to a modern cucumber. More than three thousand years after watermelon-like fruit first appeared in Egyptian iconography, in the fifth century CE, watermelons were still described by Greek and Latin authors merely as “large, round, moist, and easy to digest,” of which “best ones are sweet,” though their use of “sweet” probably just meant a not savory or bitter taste.  Not until the sixth century CE do watermelons appear to be associated with sweet fruits like figs, grapes, and pomegranates, and only well into 1400s do the uniformly red, thick-rounded watermelons that we recognize today begin to appear

### Whose vine is it anyway?
Ironically, the origins and history of the watermelon are obscured by its commonness, diversity, and its most iconic component — the tender, watery flesh, which does not survive well in the archaeological record. “Watermelon” today often refers specifically to the “sweet dessert” cultivars of the Citrullus lanatus species, but the Citrullus genus includes at least six other species of watermelons, including the citron (C. amarus) and egusi (C. mucosospermus) watermelons, which at one time either were called or were classified as subspecies of C. lanatus.  Thus the taxonomy of the sweet dessert watermelon is of minimal use for tracing its origins until further genetic analysis is confirmed; instead, literary references and depictions of watermelons stretching back millennia have been used to identify and trace the evolving phenotypes of the modern watermelon.

The species in the genus Citrullus characteristically grow on vines with pinnatifid (feather-like) leaves with only a few pale-yellow flowers. The glossy, outermost rind is often distinctly patterned with jagged stripes of two shades of green, covering a thicker, white inner rind that encases the softer flesh that, when ripe, ranges from red to yellow to green and white.  Though its origin is still in contention and has been located throughout the African continent, current hypotheses point to its origin and first domestication in northeastern Africa around 6000 years ago. Wild dessert watermelons have been found throughout Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Kenya,  and some of the earliest iconography of oblong — an indication of domestication — melons can be found in Egyptian tombs, including the famous King Tutankhamen

Early on, watermelons were welcomed in the arid savanna regions especially as sources of water, where the flesh was generally cooked or beaten to a pulp to extract the water. In the societies of Kalahari Desert in southern Africa, for example, the multiple uses of the flesh, rind, and seeds in their fresh, cooked, and dried forms enable groups to remain sedentary and hydrated throughout the wet and dry seasons.  As they continued to be cultivated, watermelons were likely bred to yield softer and sweeter flesh, excluding traits like the mucilaginous seeds of the egusi or the hard, bitter flesh of the citron melon, though western and southern African cuisines, respectively, still make use of these features today.

### Seind Red... Eventuallyurl
Since the taxonomical and genetic records remain tangled until further study, the literary, visual, and cultural references to the watermelon actually reveal a great deal about the watermelon’s history and development. The variety of terms in ancient texts — pepon, melopepon, kolokynte — and the tangled taxonomy of watermelon varieties makes it uncertain whether they refer specifically to Citrullus lanatus, but this in fact gives a vivid portrait of some of the modern watermelon’s predecessors and competitors. Around 77 CE, Pliny writes, in various sections of his Natural History dedicated to “cucumbers” of all sorts, of a pepones as a “refrigerant maxime,” whose seeds, rinds, roots, and leaves are useful for alleviating pain or inducing vomiting; the “watermelon” was not quite refreshing in the way that we enjoy it now.

Later in the millennium, watermelons arrived in India by the ninth century CE and China by the twelfth century via trade routes.  The watermelon and its sinewy vines soon became an icon seeming to express vitality, playfulness, and decoration that still persists today, appearing in Iranian encyclopedic manuscripts from the fifteenth century and as an offer to the goods in Japanese buddhist representations of arhats, the one who reaches the nirvana in Buddhist tradition), where the watermelon is seen in spiritual terms as a religious offer. It also appears alongside butterflies, insects, and even mice in Korean paintings from the early Joseon Dynasty. Shin Saimdang (1504–1551), the best-known female artist in the 16th century Joseon Dynasty, for example depicts the watermelon in symbolic interactions with nearby flowers, butterflies, and mice.  The arching vines of the watermelon plant and seeds exposed by the mice symbolize wishes for healthy and abundant children, reinforced by the nearby dianthus flower symbolizing a wish for “no white hairs,” or lasting youth. Another one of Shin’s depictions of watermelons appears on the 5000 won banknote today, as a reminder of Shin’s dedication to art, family, civic virtue, and gender equality.
